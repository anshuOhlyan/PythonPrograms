2. Write a program that will ask the user to enter a personâ€™s age, their weight, and their birth month.  Your program will compare the entered values to the following and print the appropriate responses.

def getAge():
    age = int(input("Enter your guess for age: "))
    return age

def getWeight():
    weight = int(input("Enter your guess for weight: "))
    return weight

def getMonth():
    birthMonth = input("Enter your guess for birth month:")
    return birthMonth

def correctanswers(age,weight,birthMonth):
    if age<=25:
        print("Congratulations, the age is 25 or less.")
    if weight>=128:
        print("Congratulations, the weight is 128 or more.")
    if birthMonth == "April":
        print("Congratulations, the birth month is April.")


def main():
    age = getAge()
    weight = getWeight()
    birthMonth = getMonth()
    correctanswers(age,weight,birthMonth)

main()
